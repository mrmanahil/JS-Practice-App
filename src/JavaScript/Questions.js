// In Promises we have to declare 2 variables resolve and reject in order to use then and catch function
// where as in async function we just have to write async before the function start to make it async function
// In Promises we can use then catch method to actually handle the further execution of the code
// where as in async function we can use try catch method to make the code more stable as it was
// Promises always returns the promise
// where as async function returns us the value of the promise using the await keyword
// async function is easy to make as well we only have to write async before the normal function to make it async
