// Palindrome Function
// check greatest elements in the given array , also sum all the values in an array and find the index of the greatest element in the array
// check secondHighestEle in an array
// swap the numbers
// reduce method

// check lowest elements in the given array , also subtract all the values in an array and find the index of the lowest element in the array
// last week date
// Function currying // each function taking a single argument.
// Function currying With Bind Method
// Higher Order function // a function that takes a function as an argument & | returns a new function
// Function Closures // a child function can access the arguments of the parent function
// Bind, Call And Apply
// Fibonacci Series
// Recursive Function
// Remove Duplicates From an array
// Print the Table Of 2
// Debouncing // delaying the execution of the function for specific amount of time // Example : Input field
// Throttling

//                                                  Difference between promises and async function

// In Promises we have to declare 2 variables resolve and reject in order to use then and catch function
// where as in async function we just have to write async before the function start to make it async function
// In Promises we can use then catch method to actually handle the further execution of the code
// where as in async function we can use try catch method to make the code more stable as it was
// Promises always returns the promise
// where as async function returns us the value of the promise using the await keyword
// async function is easy to make as well we only have to write async before the normal function to make it async


//                                                        NORMAL FUNCTION VS ARROW FUNCTION

// 1) Arguments can be found in normal function but not in arrow function
// 2) In Fat Arrow We cannot create a constructor where as in normal function we can create a constructor
// 3) Arrow Functions Do not have their own this where normal function has it in the object
// 4) In arrow function we can return anything in just a single line where as in normal function we cannot do that we must have to use return keyword
